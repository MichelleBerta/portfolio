                After recently becoming an empty nester, I decided to take on a
                whole new role in life. I spent twenty one years working part
                time as an office manager while my children were in school. Now
                I am looking for a career that I will find fulfilling as a web
                developer. As a coding boot camp student at SMU, I am grateful
                for this chance to learn new technology and face new challenges
                and adventures. In class I am learning the basics of HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript. Adding this knowledge to the skills I learned
                raising three children and running an office, to be task
                oriented and excellent at time management, will make me a
                valuable employee to any company. I am excited for the
                opportunity to take the skills I have been taught and apply
                them.
                <br />
                <br />
                On a personal note, entertaining and being creative are my
                favorite pass times. An example of this passion is the Live Clue
                game I created using my entire home for the game board. In
                addition I love pugs, swing dancing, escape rooms, Italy,
                meeting new people and solving a good mystery.
