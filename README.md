## Portfolio

This is my the beginning of my professional portfolio. I have many exciting things I want to do with it yet, but this is a good representation of what I can do so far.

It includes a rotation carousel of photos, dropdown menus on the nav, modals, active buttons and links and collapsible nav for mobile viewing. The entire page is responsive to account for viewing screen size.
